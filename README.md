Goowee
===
With [Goowee](https://goowee.org), you can build Progressive Web Applications using a single programming language: [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org).

The main goal of the framework is to clearly separate Business Logic from the User Interface, raising the level of abstraction so developers don’t need to work directly with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to create CRUD operations and common UIs.

Goowee is built on top of the [Grails Framework](https://grails.org), leveraging its [Conventions over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) paradigm to reduce onboarding costs, speed up development, and simplify maintenance.
